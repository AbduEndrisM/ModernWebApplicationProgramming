Diff Algorithm used to map changes from angular state to DOM

ReactJS=change eaxh state change from state to virtual DOM and then to the actual DOM. And uses diff algorithm to check if there is a change between 2 virtual DOMs.and if theres a change patch is done
setState=chnages the state in ReactJS

IN ANgular XHR, Events(user interaction) and timer makes the state change. all are Asynch. So,we should first differentiate by whom chage is triggered.

Angular1.x = AngualrJS, Angular 2x. Angular

It used to be have 2 phases to bind/patch and now its happenign only with 1 phase

NgZone- if we have something to excute afer timer stops, we can use monker-patch to 

zones used to detect chnaage detection and trigger the cycle in the DOM.

diff algorithm used to chnage the detection cycle of angular.. and is very fast, beacuse Angular by deafualt generates VM friendly monomrhic code.

when there is a change all the components checked, because their maybe  branchs or modules whiich ue the same reference to that component .. which should be 

ngOnCHnage= trigger when there is a reference is chnage. and reference is chnage when we use immutable data strucutre.

chnageDtection: ChangeDetectionStartegy.onPush = dont run chnage onCHnage ditection but onPush

observaleble is an immutable datastructre

verfication phase of anular state change is used to verify the detection is going good.

if we checked after view, we can fix it by using different ways (production and develpment phase).. production is using asynch methoc (settimout) or   . using development mode we can ignore the eerror and fix it before verifcation is called

Directives
until now we discusses how to render and do stuff on template level
directies used to add behavior to their host elements.

attribute directives: doesnt require ...DOM firendly directives
structural direct. .... and start with *
componenets are directies that have template. others doesnt have

browser module provide all the 3 direcitves

*ngIf - if true added to the DOM else not
<ng-template [ngIf] = is like any html tag... but in angular we use *ngIf
for else part = we will pass a template refernece (#ng-template #template name)

*ngSwitch 

ngStyle 
[Style] = used to give a css propertiy - is DOM property no *
ngStyle = multiple properties {object}

ngClass

*ngFor - structural direcitve

HostListner  - if a component wants to emit an event i can listen it inside my directiev =
HostBInding - serve as a shortcut for a propertiy in my directive



Pipe
pipes used to transform displayed value within a template
{{dateObj | date}} - transform the all long value of the dateObj variable to short 12/12/2012
create pipe using 2 methods cli and @Pipe decorator
pure pipe: doesnt rerun for chnage detection. can make them impure by assigning false value
impure pipe: run on every single change

Asynch pipe= impure pipe - featch asynch returned data form promises or observalbels

keyvalue pipe=
